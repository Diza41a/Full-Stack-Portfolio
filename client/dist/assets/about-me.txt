Welcome in, my name is Davyd Zakorchennyi, I'm a full-stack engineer
based in Florida. Me and my family moved to the
statesðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ around 7 years ago from UkraineðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦,
and have been operating two local bakeries here in Sarasota.

After graduating school, I briefly attended New College of Florida,
majoring in Computer Science, and attended HackReactor software
engineering immersive in 2022 to solidify the skill set I've learned,
all while building out the network of fellow minded engineers
who I've had an opportunity to work on some great web projects with.

In my work, I take priority in building out interfaces that do not
stray away from the vision of client's brand, optimizing individual
components of the web application by making them scalable, as well as
implement features that enhance user experience, making it intuitive
and maybe a little fun.
