Welcome in, my name is Davyd Zakorchennyi, I'm a full-stack engineer
based in Florida. Me and my family moved to the
statesðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ around 7 years ago from UkraineðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦,
and have been operating two local bakeries here in Sarasota.

Although being a part of a family business taught me
responsibility and integrity, as well as taught me
to listen to customers to get to the bottom of their
individual needs, my vision for the future was to grow
in a computer science area. In my opinion, it requires
constant sharpness of mind, creative thinking, and continuous
self-improvement, all while offering freedom and flexibility that
other careers lack.

After finishing school, I briefly attended New College of Florida,
but having had programming experience, I've elected on attending
HackReactor software engineering immersive, where I've had an
amazing opportunity to fill in the gaps in my education
and solidify knowledge I've already had.
I've had an opportunity to work with fellow minded
engineers in building out several frontend and backend projects,
including a shopping platform with the data API to connect to,
an online library, multiplayer checkers experience, as well as
a website for our family business.

In my work, I take priority in building out interfaces that do not
stray away from the vision of client's brand, continuously optimizing
components of the web application and making them scalable, as well as
implement features that enhance user experience, making it more intuitive
and maybe a little fun. If you'd like to connect, please reach me through
